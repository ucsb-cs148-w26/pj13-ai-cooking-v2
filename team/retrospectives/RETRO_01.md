* Being more clear in describing our issues on the kanban board.
## Stop
* being late to class
* Speding time on things that aren't useful
* Cluttering our repo with excess files that aren't neccesary or are due to a lack of communication.
## Continue
* Being proactive and making sure that we have all the right files in the repo.
* Using the kanban board to delegate tasks.
* Communicating if a member is absent via zoom or discord.

## Action item

* a goal: Delegating tasks
* a change/experiment: We want to make sure that all tasks that everyone works on is recorded in the kanaban board, and nobody has to ask if they don't have anything to do.
* a measurement: At the next sprints/retro, double check that everyone's work has been recorded properly and thuroughly in the kanban board.

## Optional

* None

It went very well, all concerns were voiced.
* What advice would you give to the next person leading a retro
  based on what you learned today? Be very descriptive of what we talk about

## Experiment/Change

A lot of times we've been confused about where each team member is at and what the next tasks are.
